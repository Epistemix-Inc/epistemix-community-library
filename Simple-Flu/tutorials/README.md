# FRED Tutorials (Simple Flu Extensions)

The Simple Flu model in the parent directory presents a foundational model of flu infection.
The tutorials in this directory, which you can complete by following the instructions in the **`tutorials.ipynb`** notebook, build on that model (and on each other) by introducing new model components and making use of additional features of the FRED modeling language. 

The models discussed in these tutorials aim to represent a flu epidemic spreading through a population, with each focusing on a different aspect of the epidemiological and behavioral phenomena surrounding the epidemic. The _flu with behavior_ tutorial introduces a behavioral response to symptomatic illness (staying home when sick) into the model. The _flu with vaccine_ tutorial allows users to explore the use of a vaccine to influence the dynamics of the epidemic.

We also hope experienced users find the models described here---along with the programming patterns employed in their implementation---to be a useful reference.
