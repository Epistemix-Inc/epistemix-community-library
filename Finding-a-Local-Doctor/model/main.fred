   Model name: Dr. office modernisation efficiency

   Description: This model is a demo model simulating health outcomes and inefficiences in a dr office. 
         Agents become ill and try to access local healthcare, becoming increasingly impatient if they are
         unable to get an appointment. This culminates in avoidable or unnecessary visits to the ED.
   Scenarios: The modernity factors allocated to the Dr Office is adjusted by:
         #Scenario_lever_1, my_modernity_factor in configure_dr_office.fred, CONDITION: CONFIGURE_DR_OFFICE, State: AssignModernityFactor

}

    locations = Kewaunee_County_WI
    start_date = 2020-Jan-01
    end_date = 2020-Feb-01
